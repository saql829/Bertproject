As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.

It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.

All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.,right? maybe not.
For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. ,there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at general electric corp. backlogs in ge's power systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid.
If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.  ,trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.

Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  ,it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of enron. he is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. andy fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.

I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.,i will complete the design selections. i will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.

For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.  ,wherever you cite section 6.2 in your response i assume you mean section 6.3.
"Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states """"Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"""".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of """"a single sum distribution"""" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition", your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.

Glad to hear their attorney contacted you.  I agree that we will not consent to the assignment unless the release and utility issue are resolved, but I would prefer to get the utility and release resolved without waiting for the 1st lienholder to consent.  Can we wrap up those issues and sign some sort of agreement to consent subject to Southern Pacific Bank's consent.,but i would prefer to get the utility and release resolved without waiting for the 1st lienholder to consent. can we wrap up those issues and sign some sort of agreement to consent subject to southern pacific bank's consent.

The two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with Paine Webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place.  They are less concerned with the services that Paine Webber doesn't offer the employees such as lending against vested options.  ,they are committed to paine webber for the foreseeable future. the two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with paine webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place. they are less concerned with the services that paine webber doesn't offer the employees such as lending against vested options.

"Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states """"Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"""".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of """"a single sum distribution"""" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition", your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.
